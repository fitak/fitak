This is fully installed Foundation framework with all components and requirements
It is compilled with Foundation CLI interface
It would be great to strip it down and integrate it with project GULP commands, but for now I don't have time for it
and I don't fully understand how Gulp, Bower and all of that utilities workflow works...
